### Example 85: [Contemporary Art Exhibition Space](https://x.com/UNIBRACITY/status/1967129632093991164) (by [@UNIBRACITY](https://x.com/UNIBRACITY))

| Example |
|:---:|
| <img src="images/case85/output.png" width="300" alt="Output result"> |

**Input:** A reference image must be uploaded.

**Prompt:**

```
An avant-garde contemporary art exhibition space themed around the reference image.
The entire exhibition hall (20.0 m x 20.0 m x 8.0 m) integrates architecture, lighting, flooring, walls, 
and ceiling into the artistic expression.

At the far end of the hall stands a massive wall 20 meters wide and 8 meters high. 
In the center of this wall, the theme from the reference image is presented in a monumental artistic form. 
The image is vivid and three-dimensional, rising toward the viewer, becoming the focal point of the entire space.

A system-generated exhibition title plaque is installed below the central wall. 
The title must be abstract, symbolic, and poetic, and must reflect a contemporary artwork. 
No price display is provided.

The floor is polished granite with a reflectance of 0.35–0.40. 
Patterns and light derived from the reference image cascade across the surface of the work, 
resonating with the entire space as if responding to the footsteps of visitors. 
Tactile paving bricks are in a similar color, seamlessly integrated, but only 5 mm high, providing a clear texture. 
The work extends in a straight line from the entrance to the wall, creating a pause point before the artwork. 
After viewing, visitors are naturally guided to an opening on the right side (3 m wide x 3 m high). 
In emergencies, floor-level emergency lighting ensures illumination of 1 lux.

The left and right walls and the ceiling each reinterpret an abstract element from the reference image, 
transforming the entire space into a single artwork. 
The flow of color, form, and light unifies the experience into an artistic whole.

Visitor capacity is limited to 8–25 people. 
All visitors face the large wall, moving in a straight line and pausing at the designated point. 
No one looks back toward the entrance. 
Only one staff member is stationed near the right-side entrance beside the wall. 
All faces are blurred to ensure anonymity.

The composition is stable, with the central vanishing point always aligned with the center of the wall. 
Verticality is within ±0.5°. 
Floor reflections are precise, human figures appear natural. 
Hands always show five fingers, eyes are symmetrical within a 3% margin. 
Fabrics remain flat with no deformation.

Forbidden content: Elements unrelated to the reference image, missing or broken tactile paving, 
visitors facing the entrance, logos or watermarks, overcrowding, toy-like gloss, 2D flat projections, 
neon glow, teal-orange tones, oversaturation, perspective collapse, mismatched reflections, 
anatomical anomalies, extra limbs, distorted faces, excessive outlines, banding, or vignetting.

DoD: The entire venue will be a contemporary artwork centered on the theme of the reference image, 
with the innermost structure forming a unified experience. 
The tactile paving synchronizes perfectly with the flow of light, creating a clear pause point. 
Visitors are immersed in the space itself, and even in reproduction, SSIM will remain stable at 0.95 or above.

The Vtuber's facial expression and pose may be changed from the original image. Have the Vtuber hold a game controller.
Place only the Vtuber's upper body in the bottom right of the screen. Place the streaming screen of the game being played in the center of the screen. Place the chat screen on the left side of the screen.
The screen ratio is set to a larger size for the game screen, and the upper half of the Vtuber's body is displayed smaller.
The background of the original image is completely ignored, as well as the original image pose.
Add a fictional streaming platform and browser UI to the top and bottom of the screen.
The aspect ratio of the generated image is independent of that of the original image.

- A cinematic movie title (impactful, authentic to the genre).  
- A short tagline or catchphrase (1–2 lines, dramatic or emotional).  
- A credit block at the bottom (with fake names for director, producer, music, etc., styled like real movie posters).  
- A release note such as “COMING SOON” or “In Theaters 2025.”  

Overlay these elements on the image in a movie-poster style layout:  
- Place the title prominently in the center or lower third.  
- Place the tagline above or below the title.  
- Add a credit block at the bottom in small text.  
- Add the release note at the bottom center.  

Finally, add the starring section at the bottom, always formatted as:

Subtle thematic details are placed throughout the room, such as framed art prints of blueprints, a floor lamp designed to resemble a specific motif (e.g., a shield or logo), and a side table with a few well-placed props (e.g., a stylized helmet). The furniture is contemporary and minimalist, with a large, comfortable sofa and a low coffee table.
